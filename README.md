# StiffNet-Benchmark
Benchmark for learning stiff dynamic system using physics-informed machine learning

Most of complex chemical dynamical systems are stiff, notably combustion, battery, and biology. While physics-informed machine learning, such as Physics-Informed Neural Network, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, has shown success in inverse problems for many non-stiff systems, it has been recently reported that it is very challanging to learn the dynamics for stiff systems. This reporsiry aims to formulate a collection of benchmark tasks to test the performance of new algorithms on learning stiff dynamical systems.
