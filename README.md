# StiffNet-Benchmark
Benchmark problems/datasets for learning stiff multi-physics multi-scale systems using physics-informed machine learning.

Numerical stiffness refers to the challenges in numerically solving systems with widely spaned time/spatial scales. Most complex multi-physics multi-scale systems are numerically stiff, for example, the equations describing the reaction-diffusion in energy conversion, pollution transportation in the atmosphere, and gene/proteins/cell interactions in biological systems. While physics-informed machine learning, such as Physics-Informed Neural Network, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, Deep Operator Learning, have shown success in many non-stiff systems, it has been shown the stiffness could fail many physics-informed machine learning algorithms. However, it is usually a painful process to prepare the datasets for stiff problems using classical numerical methods due to the nature of multi-physics, and each problem requires specific domain knowledge. This repository aims to ease the data/model preparation stage by formulating a collection of benchmark tasks for testing the performance of new algorithms on physics-informed machine learning in stiff systems.
